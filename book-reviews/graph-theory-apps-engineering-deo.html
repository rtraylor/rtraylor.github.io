  <center><h2>Review</h2></center>
<p>Graph Theory may be perhaps one of the most widely applied topics in mathematics, so any applied graph theory text has an ambitious goal. That said, the review for N. Deo's 1974 work is very mixed. The survey of applications is quite good, with some particularly interesting ones such as program segmentation, debugging, an unfortunately brief mention of chemical structure, and critical path analysis in project management. These mentions are somewhat unique to this text. The first half of the book attempts to lay the groundwork, but does a rather poor job. This should not be a reader's sole graph theory text, and it certainly should not be the introductory one. In the attempt to survey as many different things as possible, the author does skimp a bit on explanation of some things, yet over-explains others. However, the bibliography is excellent, and the author makes a good set of commentary around the most relevant citations and recommends further texts very specifically. This would make a good supplemental text to an introductory graph theory course, but the instructor will have a lot of work cut out for him/her in order to ensure the material is presented appropriately. </p>
