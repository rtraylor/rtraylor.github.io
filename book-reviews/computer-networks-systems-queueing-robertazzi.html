  <center><h2>Review</h2></center>
<p>I wanted to like this book. Truly, I did. This time, the best thing I can say about this work is that the bibliography is extensive. I'm honestly not sure who the intended readers of this text were. It couldn't be engineers, since the mathematical expectation was far too high, and too many steps were glossed over for this to be of any use to an engineer. If mathematicians, then it would have to be advanced ones given the exposition, but then the author wastes 8 pages deriving moments and cumulative distribution functions of the binomial distribution towards the end of the book. The case studies pulled from the literature were useful, but the author all but copy-pasted each one. Entire sections of the book were simply ripped from some piece of literature, and a lazy citation apparently made that ok. 
</p>
<p>
For the good points, I personally did see some queuing treatments I hadn't seen before. Of note is an algebraic topological interpretation of product-form solutions in queuing networks; an attempt to understand why product-form solutions occur and to study any underlying structure. Unfortunately, in checking the references, it was the author's own work, so I can't expect any better writing if I return to the primary source. The topics covered seem pretty standard for a queuing book, but the author strangely manages to overcomplicate even a discussion of M/M/1 queues. 
</p>
<p>
This work should only be used as a cursory survey for professional researchers in queuing theory; I can't even recommend this for engineers or mathematicians not already deeply familiar with queuing intricacies. One last petty complaint here as I end my most negative review yet is that I have never seen typesetting as lazy and atrocious as what's in this book. Save your money and make a copy of the bibliography while visiting your local library.  </p>
