  <center><h2>Review</h2></center>
<p>Welcome one and all, to a calculus book I taught from at Georgia Tech for long enough that I could almost tell you the page certain topics started on. This book is absolutely meant as an introduction to calculus, and is a more modern take with an engineering and applied focus. Your favorite feature of the book is likely to be just inside the from and back covers, where the antiderivatives of many common functions reside. The text is thick and comprehensive, covering one and multivariable calculus. There are many visual illustrations throughout each chapter, and plenty of good examples that are well worked out. It does prove some of the major theorems, which I also like. Since calculus is ultimately a fundamental skill  in mathematics, much of learning it may feel a bit like running drills - integrate these 20 different things, etc. Numerous exercises are provided at a wide range of difficulty as the reader gains skill. The "word problems" can be a little contrived, but are still important and clear enough to develop the skill in translating an engineering-like problem into the mathematics world. The back of the textbook contains odd-numbered answers as well. There is also a student and instructor's solutions manual that can be purchased separately. Overall, this text is suitable for advanced high school students or university undergraduates. My recommendation would be to split the material into two semesters, as the text is comprehensive but very dense. The language is readable as well, especially for anyone going back and needing a bit of a self-study refresher of calculus.  </p>
