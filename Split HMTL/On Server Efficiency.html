<h2 style="text-align: left;">Abstract</h2>
<em>Editor's note: This paper comprises the second chapter of the PhD dissertation by Rachel Traylor</em>. Cha and Lee defined a mathematical notion of server performance by measuring efficiency [latex]\psi[/latex] defined as the long run average number of jobs completed per unit time. The service time distribution heavily influences the shape of the server efficiency as a function of a constant arrival rate [latex]\lambda[/latex]. Various classes of distributions are studied in order to find sufficient conditions for the existence of a single maximum. The existence of a maximum allows for simple binary control policies to handle traffic and optimize performance.
<h2>Introduction, Motivation, and Background</h2>
Cha and Lee [1]&nbsp;studied the reliability of a single server under a constant stress workload, and also defined a notion of server efficiency [latex]\psi[/latex] for a given intensity [latex]\lambda(t)[/latex] as the long-run average number of jobs completed per unit time as a way to measure server performance. With the number of jobs completed as [latex]M[/latex], the efficiency is defined

[latex, display = true]\psi := \lim\limits_{t \to \infty}\frac{E[M(t)]}{t}[/latex]

Upon breakdown and rebooting, the server is assumed to be ‘as good as new’, in that performance of the server does not degrade during subsequent reboots. In addition, the model assumes the arrival process after reboot, denoted [latex]\{N^{*}(t), t \geq 0\}[/latex], is a nonhomogenous Poisson process with the same intensity function [latex]\lambda(t)[/latex] as before, and that [latex]\{N^{*}(t), t \geq 0\}[/latex] is independent of the arrival process before reboot. In a practical setting, this model assumes no ‘bottlenecking’ of arrivals occurs in the queue during server downtime that would cause an initial flood to the rebooted server. In addition, the reboot time is assumed to follow a continuous distribution [latex]H(t)[/latex] with expected value [latex]\nu[/latex]. This process is a renewal reward process, with the renewal [latex]\{R_{n}\} = \{M_{n}\}[/latex], the number of jobs completed. The length of a renewal cycle is [latex]Y_{n} + H_{n}[/latex], where [latex]Y_{n}[/latex] is the length of time the server was operational, and [latex]H_{n}[/latex] is the time to reboot after a server crash. Then, by&nbsp;[2],

[latex, display = true]\psi = \frac{E[M]}{E[Y]+ \nu}[/latex]

where [latex]M[/latex] is the number of jobs completed in a particular renewal cycle, [latex]\nu[/latex]
is the mean time to reboot of the server, and [latex]Y[/latex] is the length of a particular renewal cycle. Then, using&nbsp;the definition of [latex]\psi[/latex]&nbsp;the following closed form of the efficiency of a server under all assumptions of Cha and Lee's model is derived.

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Theorem 1 (Server Efficiency under Cha/Lee)</strong></span></em>
Suppose [latex]\{N(t), t \geq 0\}[/latex] is a nonhomogenous Poisson process with intensity [latex]\lambda(t)\geq 0[/latex]. Then the efficiency is given by

[latex, display = true]\begin{aligned}\psi&amp;=\frac{1}{\int_{0}^{\infty}S_{Y}(t)dt + \nu}\left[\exp\left(-\int_{0}^{t}r_{0}(x)dx-\int_{0}^{t}\lambda(x)dx + a(t) + b(t)\right)\right.\\&amp;\qquad\qquad\left.\times\left(r_{0}(t)a(t)+\eta a(t)b(t) \right)\right]\end{aligned}[/latex]
where [latex]a(t) = \int_{0}^{t}e^{-\eta v}g_{W}(v)m(t-v)dv[/latex], [latex]b(t) = \int_{0}^{t}e^{-\eta(t-r)}\bar{G}_{W}(t-r)\lambda(r)dr[/latex], [latex]\bar{G}_{W}(x) = 1-\int_{0}^{x}g_{W}(s)ds[/latex], and [latex]m(x) = \int_{0}^{x}\lambda(s)ds[/latex].

<h3>Numerical Example and Control Policies</h3>
[caption id="attachment_1200" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://www.themathcitadel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/EffRayleigh.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1200 size-medium" src="http://www.themathcitadel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/EffRayleigh-300x191.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="191"></a> Figure 1: Efficiency under Rayleigh Distribution[/caption]

As an illustrative example, Cha and Lee considered the case when [latex]\lambda(t) \equiv \lambda[/latex],
[latex]r_{0}(t) \equiv r_{0} = 0.2[/latex], [latex]\eta = 0.01[/latex], [latex]\nu = 1[/latex], and [latex]g_{W}(w) = we^{-w^{2}/2}[/latex] (the PDF of the Rayleigh distribution). As shown in Figure&nbsp;1, there exists a [latex]\lambda^{*}[/latex] such that [latex]\psi(\lambda)[/latex] is maximized. Thus one may implement the obvious optimal control policy for server control to avoid server overload:

&nbsp;(1) If the real time arrival rate [latex]\lambda &lt; \lambda^{*}[/latex], do not interfere with arrivals.

&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;If [latex]\lambda \geq \lambda^{*}[/latex], facilitate some appropriate measure of interference.

Examples of interference for a web server in particular include rejection of incoming requests or possible re-routing. Cha and Lee give an interference policy of rejection with probability [latex]1-\frac{\lambda^{*}}{\lambda}[/latex].

The Rayleigh distribution used in Figure&nbsp;1&nbsp;has applications in physics, typically when the magnitude of a vector is related to its directional components. It is a special case of the Weibull distribution which is widely used in survival analysis, failure analysis, weather forecasting, and communications.&nbsp;These distributions are not typically used to model service times. The exponential distribution is the most common due to its memoryless properties, followed by the Erlang and uniform distributions.

The efficiency, [latex]\psi[/latex], under the Rayleigh distribution example in Figure&nbsp;1&nbsp;shows the existence of a [latex]0 &lt; \lambda^{*} &lt; \infty[/latex] such that [latex]\psi(\lambda)[/latex] is maximized at [latex]\lambda^{*}[/latex].&nbsp;This useful feature of [latex]\psi(\lambda)[/latex] in this case allows for the implementation of a simple control policy for arrivals to the server to prevent overload, given above.&nbsp;

Numerical simulations under a variety of possible distribution classes, including convex, concave, exponential, uniform, and Erlang suggest that the mathematical properties of [latex]\psi[/latex] are heavily influenced by the choice and characteristics of service time distribution [latex]g_{W}(w)[/latex]. In particular, it is of interest to seek sufficient conditions of [latex]g_{W}(w)[/latex] that will guarantee the existence of a [latex]\lambda^{*}[/latex] that maximizes [latex]\psi[/latex]. This is done for the uniform, compact support, and Erlang classes. Furthermore, it is shown under certain conditions, not only does the server efficiency lack a maximum, but [latex]\psi[/latex] increases without bound. This is not representative of real server behavior, and thus of mathematical and practical interest to note for further modeling.

&nbsp;
<h2>Efficiency of a Server under Uniform Service Life Distribution</h2>
Suppose [latex]\lambda(x) \equiv \lambda[/latex], and suppose [latex]r_{0}(x) \equiv r_{0} = \max_{x \in (0,\infty)}r_{0}(x)[/latex]. The efficiency [latex]\psi[/latex] is given for constant [latex]\eta[/latex] and [latex]\lambda[/latex] here:
[latex, display &nbsp;= true]\psi(\lambda) = \frac{1}{\int_{0}^{\infty}S_{Y}(t)dt + \nu}\left[\int_{0}^{\infty}\exp\left(-r_{0}t-\lambda t + a(t)+b(t)\right)(r_{0}+b(t))a(t)dt\right][/latex]

where [latex]S_{Y}(t)[/latex] is the survival function of the node, [latex]a(t) = \int_{0}^{t}e^{-\eta v}g(v)(t-v)dv[/latex], [latex]b(t) = \int_{0}^{t}e^{-\eta(t-r)}\bar{G}(t-r)dr[/latex],
[latex]g(v)[/latex] is the pdf of the service time distribution, and [latex]\bar{G}(x) = 1-\int_{0}^{x}g(s)ds[/latex].

The following theorem gives sufficient conditions for the uniform distribution and [latex]\eta[/latex] that guarantee the existence of a finite maximum efficiency.

<hr>

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Theorem 2(Efficiency under Uniform Service Distribution)</strong></span></em>
Suppose the service life distribution is given by Uniform([latex]c,d[/latex]) for some [latex]0&lt;c&lt;d[/latex]. Then if
[latex]\sigma &gt; \frac{ce^{-c\eta}}{\sqrt{12}\phi(-\eta)(1+\eta(c+d))+c\eta - 1}[/latex] where [latex]\phi(-\eta)[/latex] the standard deviation of the service life [latex]W[/latex], [latex]\psi(\lambda)[/latex] has a maximum on [latex](0,\infty)[/latex]&nbsp;is the moment generating function of a uniform distribution evaluated at [latex]-\eta[/latex].

<hr>

&nbsp;

Numerical simulations suggest that [latex]\psi[/latex] increases without bound for [latex]c=0, d&gt;1[/latex]. The following lemma proves this fact.

&nbsp;

<hr>

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lemma</strong></span></em>
Suppose the service life distribution is given by Uniform(0,d), with [latex]d&gt;1[/latex]. Then [latex]\psi[/latex] increases without bound.

<hr>

This is worth discussing here. It makes no sense whatsoever for the efficiency of a server to increase forever as the arrival rate increases. So what's happening here? Notice that if the uniform distribution include 0 as an endpoint, then there is a positive probability that the service time for a job will be exactly 0 (in whatever time units you like). This is impossible in reality. A small service time is possible, but it's still strictly greater than 0. What we see here is that using distributions with positive support at 0 causes issues in the efficiency function; it's not the fault of the definition of efficiency, but rather a consequence of using distributions that cannot mirror reality. The next section explores this further with a more broad class of distributions.

<h2>Extension of the Uniform Distribution: Compact Support</h2>
The ideas and techniques presented in the previous section&nbsp;yield a powerful extension to any service life distribution with compact support away from 0. Supposing [latex]g_{W}(w)[/latex] has compact support [latex][a,b][/latex], it may be bounded above by a positively scaled uniform distribution. In practice, service times are finite and nonzero, thus this extension allows for very simple control policies to be implemented for a much larger class of distributions.

&nbsp;

<hr>

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Theorem 3 (Efficiency under Compact Support)</strong></span></em>
Let [latex]g_{W}(w)[/latex] be the pdf of the service times having compact support [latex][c,d], d &gt; 0[/latex]. Let [latex]m = \max_{w}g_{W}(w) &lt; \infty[/latex], and [latex]R = (d-c)[/latex] be the length of the support. Then [latex]\psi(\lambda)[/latex] has a maximum if [latex]m &lt; \frac{c}{R\eta +e^{-b\eta}-e^{-a\eta}+\eta e^{-a\eta}}[/latex].

<strong>Example 1</strong>

Let [latex]g_{W}(w) = \frac{2}{5}w\mathbb{1}_{[2,3]}(w)[/latex], and let [latex]r_{0} = \nu = \eta = 1[/latex]. Then [latex]m = \frac{6}{5}[/latex]. By Theorem&nbsp;2, [latex]m &lt; \frac{2}{e^{-2}+e^{-3}+1}\approx 1.678[/latex]. Thus, the existence of a maximum [latex]\psi[/latex] is guaranteed. Figure&nbsp;2&nbsp;gives the numerical result with step size of 0.1. The maximum occurs around [latex]\lambda^{*} = 0.5[/latex].&nbsp;

&nbsp;

[caption id="attachment_1207" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://www.themathcitadel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/EfficiencyIncreasing1to2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1207 size-large" src="http://www.themathcitadel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/EfficiencyIncreasing1to2-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427"></a> Figure 3: Efficiency under an increasing distribution with support on [1,2][/caption]
<strong>Example 2: Sufficient conditions aren't always necessary conditions</strong>
The condition given in Theorem 2 is rather weak and is only a sufficient condition. As an illustration, consider the same increasing density shifted to a support of [latex][1,2][/latex]. Thus
[latex]g_{W}(w) = \frac{2}{3}w\mathbb{1}_{[1,2]}(w)[/latex]. Retain all other assumptions from Example&nbsp;1. Then
[latex, display = true]m = \frac{4}{3} &gt; \frac{1}{e^{-2}+1} \approx 0.88[/latex]
which violates the condition. However, consider Figure 3 above. Clearly [latex]\psi[/latex] has a maximum at approximately [latex]\lambda^{*} = 0.8[/latex].&nbsp;
The condition given in Theorem&nbsp;2&nbsp;relies on overestimating [latex]g_{W}(w)[/latex] by a constant. If the variance [latex]\sigma_{W}^{2}[/latex] of [latex]g_{W}(w)[/latex] is large, the maximum of the pdf will decrease and be more comparable to the rest of the distribution. In these cases, bounding [latex]g_{W}(w)[/latex] by its max [latex]m[/latex] over the support [latex][a,b][/latex] will give a reasonable approximation. However, in the case of a small support and high enough skew compared to the size and location of the support, much of the mass is concentrated at the right end of the support, and [latex]m[/latex] will be higher. In these cases, bounding [latex]g_{W}(w)[/latex] by [latex]m[/latex] will result in a large amount of overestimation, and thus the condition may fail, but [latex]\psi[/latex] still has a maximum. The numerical example wherein [latex]g_{W}(w) = \frac{2}{3}w\mathbb{1}_{[1,2]}(w)[/latex] illustrates the conservative nature of this type of estimation.

<h2>Efficiency under Erlang Service Distribution</h2>
Now suppose [latex]g(v)[/latex] is of the Erlang class but shifted [latex]\delta &gt; 0[/latex] to the right. For motivation, consider that service times can never be 0 in a practical setting. Then the PDF and the complement of the CDF are given by
[latex, display = true]\begin{aligned}g(v;k,\gamma,\delta) &amp;= \left\{\begin{array}{lr}0, &amp; 0 \leq v \leq \delta \\\frac{\gamma^{k}(v-\delta)^{k-1}e^{-\gamma(v-\delta)}}{(k-1)!}, &amp; v\geq \delta\end{array}\right.\\\bar{G}(v;k,\gamma,\delta) &amp;= \left\{\begin{array}{lr}1, &amp; 0 \leq v \leq \delta \\e^{\gamma(\delta-v)}\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\frac{\gamma^{j}(v-\delta)^{j}}{j!}, &amp; v\geq \delta\end{array}\right.\end{aligned}[/latex]

<hr>

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Theorem 4 (Server Efficiency under Erlang Distribution)</strong></span></em>
Let [latex]\delta &gt; 0, \eta &gt; 0[/latex]. Let [latex]\alpha(\delta) = \left(\frac{\gamma}{\gamma + \eta}\right)^{k}e^{-\eta\delta} + \frac{\gamma^{k}e^{\gamma\delta}(k-1)}{(\eta + \gamma)^{k-1}}[/latex], and [latex]0 &lt; \beta(\delta,\eta) &lt; 1[/latex]. If the service life distribution is of the [latex]\delta-[/latex]shifted Erlang class, then [latex]\psi(\lambda)[/latex] has a maximum in [latex]\lambda[/latex] on [latex](0,\infty)[/latex] for [latex]\delta,\eta[/latex] such that [latex]\alpha(\delta) + \beta(\delta,\eta) &lt; 1[/latex].

<hr>

Thus, we see that the Erlang service distribution produces a maximum as long as the support is shifted away from 0.&nbsp;
<h2>Efficiency under Exponential Distribution</h2>
The exponential distribution is the most common service distribution assumed for a queue. The M/M/1 queue assumes a Poisson distribution for arrival times, and an exponential distribution or service times. However, the exponential distribution has most of its mass concentrated at or near 0. As we have seen in other distributions, this becomes a problem, both in considering what makes sense in practical applications, and in its effect on the efficiency.&nbsp;
Suppose [latex]g(v)[/latex] is of the exponential class. That is, [latex]g(v) = \gamma e^{-\gamma v}, \gamma &gt; 0[/latex]. It will be proven that under certain conditions on [latex]\eta[/latex] and [latex]\gamma[/latex], an exponential [latex]g(v)[/latex] causes [latex]\psi[/latex] to increase without bound.

&nbsp;

<hr>

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Theorem 5 (</strong></span></em><b><i><u>Efficiency under Exponential Distribution)</u></i></b>
Suppose [latex]g(v) = \gamma e^{-\gamma v}[/latex]. Then if [latex]\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma + \eta} &gt; 1 + \frac{2}{\frac{2}{\gamma} + W\left(-\frac{\gamma}{\gamma +\eta}e^{-2-\frac{2\eta}{\gamma}}\right)}[/latex], [latex]\psi(\lambda) \to \infty[/latex], &nbsp;as [latex]\lambda \to \infty[/latex] where [latex]W(\cdot)[/latex] is the Lambert W-function.

<hr>

&nbsp;
<h2>Extension to Random Stress and Nonconstant Intensity</h2>
All the above theorems regarding the server efficiency&nbsp; assumed constant stress [latex]\eta[/latex] and constant intensity [latex]\lambda[/latex]. This section generalizes the analyses in the previous sections&nbsp;for nonconstant intensity and random stress.

The stochastic reliability models in both [1] &nbsp;and <a href="http://www.themathcitadel.com/2017/06/11/stochastic-reliability-of-a-server-under-a-random-workload/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the previous chapter</a>&nbsp;both assumed a time-dependent intensity [latex]\lambda(t)[/latex]. By setting [latex]\lambda \equiv \max_{t}\lambda(t)[/latex], the established efficiency theorems&nbsp;provide a conservative set of conditions under which a maximum efficiency may be obtained. In these cases, [latex]\psi[/latex] is actually a function of all possible [latex]\lambda_{\max}[/latex].

If the job stresses are random, as in Theorem 2 of <a href="http://www.themathcitadel.com/2017/06/11/stochastic-reliability-of-a-server-under-a-random-workload/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Traylor (2016)</a>, the above sections may still be utilized. Assume the sample space for [latex]\mathcal{H}[/latex] is compact and nonnegative. The efficiency is given by Theorem&nbsp;2 of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.themathcitadel.com/2017/06/11/stochastic-reliability-of-a-server-under-a-random-workload/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Traylor (2016)</a>.
WLOG, again suppose the sample space of [latex]\mathcal{H}[/latex] is discrete, given by [latex]\{\eta_{1},...,\eta_{m}\}[/latex] with respective probabilities [latex]p_{i}, i =1,...,m[/latex]. Now suppose all mass is concentrated at [latex]\eta_{[m]}[/latex]. Let [latex]a_{m}(t) = \lambda\int_{0}^{t}e^{-\eta_{m}v}g(v)(t-v)dv[/latex], and [latex]b_{m}(t) = \lambda\int_{0}^{t}e^{-\eta_{m}(t-r)}\bar{G}_{W}(t-r)dr[/latex]. Then, the following are true:
(1) [latex]E_{\mathcal{H}}[a(t)+b(t)] \leq a_{m}(t) + b_{m}(t)[/latex]&nbsp;

(2)[latex]E_{\mathcal{H}}[a(t)] \leq a_{m}(t)[/latex]

(3)&nbsp;[latex]E_{\mathcal{H}}[\mathcal{H} a(t)b(t)] \leq \eta_{m}a_{m}(t)b_{m}(t)[/latex]

Thus, by replacing the expectations in (1)-(3) with their respective upper bounds in the efficiency theorems, analyses of the efficiency for the uniform, compact support, and Erlang classes may proceed as previously detailed. These estimates are conservative but sufficient.

For an exponential service life distribution and random stress, create a lower bound for the expectations in
(1)-(3) by concentrating all mass at [latex]\eta_{[1]}[/latex]. Then the conditions from Theorem 5 guarantee an explosion for the exponential distribution.

<h2>Implications and Numerical Illustrations</h2>
<h3>Uniform Service Distribution</h3>
[huge_it_portfolio id="7"]

&nbsp;Click on an image in the&nbsp;gallery to expand and explore the efficiency of a server under different instances of the uniform service distribution.
For the uniform service distribution, both the variance of [latex]g_{W}(w)[/latex] and the location of the support affect the efficiency itself. The gallery above&nbsp;shows [latex]\psi(\lambda)[/latex] for various uniform distributions as an illustration. In all four cases, [latex]r_{0} = \nu =\eta =1[/latex]. The variance of a uniform distribution is given by [latex]\sigma^{2} = \frac{d-c}{12}[/latex]. With the exception of the fourth gallery image, which illustrates the explosion of [latex]\psi[/latex] when the distribution has positive mass at 0, Table&nbsp;1 below&nbsp;compares possible values of [latex]\psi[/latex] for different Uniform distributions. Notice that while the variance [latex]\sigma^{2}[/latex] does affect the range of [latex]\psi[/latex] by several orders of magnitude, the location of the support has a much more powerful effect. Thus, if all service times are equally likely, a server is less efficient if it is consistently but mildly slow (Uniform[10,11]) compared to an inconsistent server (Uniform[1,500]).

[latex, display = true]\begin{array}{l|rrrr}g_{W}(w) &amp; \sigma^{2}&amp;\mu&amp; \text{Approximate Range of } \psi &amp; \text{Approximate } \lambda^{*}\\\text{Uniform}[1,2] &amp; 1/12 &amp;1.5 &amp; (0,0.012) &amp; 1.3\\ \text{Uniform}[10,11] &amp; 1/12 &amp;10.5 &amp; (0, 2\times10^{-11}) &amp; 0.1 \\ \text{Uniform}[1,500] &amp; 499/12 &amp; 250.5 &amp; (0,3\times 10^{-5}) &amp; 1.6\end{array}[/latex]

&nbsp;
<h3>Increasing but Compact Service Distribution</h3>
[huge_it_portfolio id="8"]

Click to expand and explore.&nbsp;

[latex, display = true]\begin{array}{l|rrrr}g_{W}(w) &amp; \sigma^{2}&amp;\mu&amp; \text{Approx. Range of } \psi &amp; \text{Approx. } \lambda^{*}\\\small{\frac{2w}{3}}\mathbb{1}_{[1,2]}(w)&amp; \approx 0.0802&amp;\approx 1.56 &amp; (0,7\times10^{-3}) &amp; 0.75\\\small{\frac{2w}{5}}\mathbb{1}_{[2,3]}(w)&amp;\approx 0.0822 &amp;\approx 2.53 &amp; (0, 7\times10^{-4}) &amp; 0.5 \\\small{\frac{2w}{500^{2}-1}}\mathbb{1}_{[1,500]}(w)&amp; \approx 13888&amp; 333.35 &amp; (0,1.3\times 10^{-7})&amp; 1.4\end{array}[/latex]

As an illustration of a distribution on compact support, consider the class of increasing densities [latex]g_{W}(w) = cx\mathbb{1}_{[a,b]}(x)[/latex]. Several examples are given in the above gallery&nbsp;table. For both compact supports of length 1, the variance is approximately the same, but the mean changes, producing an order of magnitude decrease in efficiency. Compared to the compact support of length 499, with a much larger mean, the efficiency decreases by 3 orders of magnitude. Notice, however, that the decline after the maximum is much less sharp.

&nbsp;
<h3>Erlang Service Distribution</h3>
[huge_it_portfolio id="9"]

Click on an image to explore.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

[latex, display = true]\begin{array}{l|rrrr}g_{W}(w) &amp; \sigma^{2}&amp;\mu&amp; \text{Approx. Range of } \psi &amp; \text{Approx. } \lambda^{*}\\\text{Erlang}(2,1)&amp; 2&amp;2 &amp; (0,0.7)&amp; 9\\\text{Erlang}(9,1)&amp;9 &amp;9 &amp; (0, 4\times10^{-6}) &amp; 0.5 \\\text{Rayleigh}(1)&amp; (4-\pi)/2&amp; \sqrt{\pi/2} &amp; (0,0.9)&amp; 8\end{array}[/latex]
The gallery above&nbsp;gives two examples of [latex]\psi[/latex] under an Erlang distribution. Notice the change in the efficiency as the mean increases. Here, since [latex]\lambda =1[/latex], [latex]\sigma^{2} = \mu[/latex], so the mean likely has the largest effect on [latex]\psi[/latex].
<h3>Comparing all the examples</h3>
Comparing all examples, the Rayleigh(1) service distribution imposes the highest maximum efficiency, followed closely by the Erlang(2,1) service distribution, with the Uniform[1,2] service distribution following. [latex]\lambda^{*}[/latex] under the Erlang(2,1) service distribution is larger than for the Rayleigh(1) service distribution, indicating that a server whose service times follow the former distribution can handle a larger arrival intensity before its efficiency begins to decline than the latter.

The means for the Rayleigh(1), Erlang(2,1), and Uniform[1,2] distributions are similar, as shown in the tables, but the Uniform[1,2] distribution has equal probability of any service time in its support with large negative excess kurtosis. It is posulated that kurtosis, skew, and variance play large roles in the behavior and range of [latex]\psi[/latex]. Compare the efficiency under the Erlang(2,1) service distribution with the efficiency under the Erlang(9,1) service distribution. Not only is the mean much lower for the Erlang(2,1) distribution, but the distribution is more strongly positive-skewed than the Erlang(9,1). Thus, more mass is concentrated at the left side of the distribution, indicating that the service times are more often shorter.

Finally, to note the effect of the typical stress level [latex]\eta[/latex] on the range of [latex]\psi[/latex],&nbsp;we compare the original Cha/Lee figure with our Rayleigh figure above. The service distribution and all other quantities remain the same, but Cha and Lee's numerical example set [latex]\eta = 0.01[/latex], whereas the third image in the Erlang gallery&nbsp;shows [latex]\psi[/latex] under [latex]\eta = 1[/latex]. The range of [latex]\psi[/latex] decreases by two orders of magnitude with a 100 fold increase in [latex]\eta[/latex], with the shape remaining similar. In addition, the location of the maximum [latex]\lambda^{*}[/latex] also inversely varies by the same magnitude.

Studying the efficiency under various service distributions aids not only in deciding when to implement a server intervention, but also aids in evaluating the performance of various servers given their service times.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Many questions have been opened up about the various effects of the service distribution and stress on the server efficiency. The conditions given above are merely sufficient conditions, and have not been proven necessary. Studying the efficiency as a function of the arrival rate under various service distributions and stress provides a way to understand the performance of a server and the various factors that can affect it mathematically.

			Can I just say what a comfort to uncover a person that actually knows what they’re discussing on the internet.You certainly understand how to bring a problem to light and make it important.A lot more people need to read this and understand this sideof the story. I was surprised that you are not more popular because you most certainly possessthe gift.

			Howdy would you mind sharing which blog platform you’re working with? I’m looking to start my own blog soon but I’m having a difficult time deciding between BlogEngine/Wordpress/B2evolution and Drupal. The reason I ask is because your layout seems different then most blogs and I’m looking for something unique.                  P.S My apologies for being off-topic but I had to ask!
