				The Math Citadel is happy to host Carnival of Mathematics edition [latex]154[/latex], where we take a look at math blog posts from all around. For all those interested in Carnival of Mathematics future and past, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://aperiodical.com/carnival-of-mathematics/">The Aperiodical</a>.
<h2>Observing Tradition</h2>
To get things started, we present a few interesting properties of [latex]154[/latex], in keeping with Carnival of Mathematics custom. &nbsp;Firstly, [latex]154[/latex] is a <em>palindrome</em> when written in bases [latex]6[/latex], [latex]8[/latex], [latex]9[/latex], and [latex]13[/latex]:

[latex, display=true]154=414_6=282_8=181_9=\text{BB}_{13}.[/latex]

The nearest primes to 154 are 151 and 157. &nbsp;Since 154 is equidistant from these, that is,

[latex, display=true]|154-151|=3=|154-157|,[/latex]

154 is referred to as an&nbsp;<em>interprime number</em>.&nbsp;

Finally, a triangle rotated internally 154 times[note]Counting them all the way inward is going to be a little difficult. Made with tikz, the wonderful LaTeX package that we use for our research diagrams.[/note].&nbsp;

Now on to this month's post selection.
<h2>What to Read</h2>
First off, Anthony Bonato discusses the hierarchy of infinities and formative study in axiomatic set theory that brought about The Continuum Hypothesis, in <a href="https://anthonybonato.com/2018/01/03/the-continuum-hypothesis/">a post by the same name</a> at&nbsp;<a href="https://anthonybonato.com">The Intrepid Mathematician</a>. Included is a brief account of mathematicians GÃ¶del and Cohen and their respective constructions of set theory to uphold or prove false the hypothesis.

Next, Arvind Rao examines the case of defining a circle by three non-colinear points in the plane in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rao.im/mathematics/2017/06/30/three-points-make-a-circle/">3 Points Make a Circle</a>. The evidence in the affirmative that any such three points do <em>indeed</em> define a circle&nbsp;is presented via straight edge and compass as well as programmatically[note]I personally encourage the reader to try both at leisure.[/note].

In abstract algebra, we include a post of our own,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.themathcitadel.com/all-the-same-opposites/">All the Same Opposites</a>, which demonstrates some of the many forms taken by [latex]\text{GF}(2)[/latex] and the significance of their structural equivalence.&nbsp;

At Quanta Magazine, Patrick Honner presents the mathematical reasoning behind vaccines in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/flu-vaccines-and-the-math-of-herd-immunity-20180205/">How Math (and Vaccines) Keep You Safe From the Flu</a>, comparing linear and exponential growth rates as basis for understanding how illnesses spread. And Kevin Hartnett discusses the Navier-Stokes Equations and why these merit a spot on the list of Millennium Problems in mathematics in <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-makes-the-hardest-equations-in-physics-so-difficult-20180116/">What Makes the Hardest Equations in Physics So Difficult?</a>&nbsp;

We close with probability theory. Our own Dr. Rachel Traylor writes about the rare (and historically neglected) "singular continuous distributions" in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.themathcitadel.com/the-red-headed-step-distributions/">The Red-Headed Step-Distributions</a>. Lastly, an older post: Will Kurt at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.countbayesie.com">Count Bayesie</a>&nbsp;gives a detailed look into Kullback-Leibler divergence and its information theoretic roots in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2017/5/9/kullback-leibler-divergence-explained">Kullback-Leibler Divergence Explained</a>.
