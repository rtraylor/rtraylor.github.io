<h1>Book Reviews</h1>

<h3>Our book reviews are organized by category. Click to explore texts we've reviewed. We always complete a text prior to reviewing and list topics covered.  </h3>

<h2>Mathematics</h2>
<table width="100%" border = "1">
    <tr>
        <td>
	<h2><a href = "book-review-subpages/m-aem.html">Applied and Engineering Mathematics</a></h2>
	<big>
	Includes texts that are focused on applied mathematics such as control theory, dynamical systems, queueing theory, reliability theory, signal processing, and finite element methods. 
	</big>
	</td>
        <td>
	<h2>Fundamentals</h2>
	<big>Texts that discuss the foundations of most mathematics: calculus, logic, set theory, and trigonometry</big>
	</td>
	<td>
	<h2>Recreational Mathematics</h2>
	<big>Books with puzzles, problems, and general curiosities</big>
	</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><h2><a href = "book-review-subpages/m-alg.html">Algebra</a></h2>
	<big>Modern/abstract algebra, category theory, linear algebra, and matrix theory</big>
	</td>
        <td><h2>Geometry</h2>
	<big>One of the broadest topics in mathematics with many flavors: algebraic, differential, Euclidean, non-Euclidean...</big>  
	</td>
        <td><h2>Rudimentary Mathematics</h2>
	<big>Includes mathematics at the primary and secondary levels such as arithmetic and basic algebra</big>
	 </td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
	<td><h2><a href = "book-review-subpages/m-ana.html">Analysis</a></h2>
	<big>Texts in calculus of variations, complex analysis, functional analysis, numerical analysis, real analysis, and general mathematical analysis</big>
	</td>
	<td><h2>Number Theory</h2>
	<big>Texts full of the study of numbers, both basic and quite advanced</big>
	</td>
	<td><h2>Statistics and Data Science</h2>
	<big>Works practical and theoretical in computational statistics, design of experiments, linear models, nonparametric statistics, Bayesian statistics, theoretical statistics, inference, and time series analysis</big>
	</td>

	<tr>
	<td><h2><a href = "book-review-subpages/m-die.html">Differential and Integral Equations</a></h2>
	<big>Theoretical and applied differential equations, partial differential equations, and integral equations</big>
	</td>
	<td><h2>Probability</h2>
	<big>Separated from statistics, this includes the study of probability from algebraic, analytic, and geometric perspectives, as well as stochastic analysis and stochastic processes. </big>
	</td>
	<td><h2>Topology</h2>
	<big>A branch of mathematics so fundamental it needs its own category. </big>
	</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><h2>Discrete Mathematics</h2>
	<big>Includes Boolean mathematics, combinatorics, cryptography, and graph theory</big>
